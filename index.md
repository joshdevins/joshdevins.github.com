## Professional Summary

I'm an engineer and passionate whiteboarder based in Berlin, Germany. I currently work for [Amen](http://www.getamen.com) as a Software Engineer and resident Data Nerd. My focus is on building data-driven features using search, analytics, a touch of machine learning and lovely APIs. I make software with things I'm keen on: simplicity, agile methodologies and development, openness (people, source and information), parallel and distributed computing, data, messaging, devops, pragmatism, big pictures, interaction, experiences and oh so much more!
